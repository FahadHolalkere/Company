1) Tech Stack:
    ->Backend: Node.js with Express framework for building RESTful APIs.
    ->Database: MongoDB for storing event data.
    ->Dependencies: Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling, csvtojson for parsing CSV data, axios for making HTTP requests.

2) Design Decisions:
    ->Chose Express for its simplicity and robustness in building web applications and APIs.
    ->Used MongoDB due to its flexibility, scalability, and compatibility with Node.js.
    ->Implemented pagination logic to efficiently handle large datasets and improve performance.
    ->Used async/await for asynchronous operations to write cleaner and more readable code.

3) Challenges Addressed:
    ->Parsing and inserting CSV data into MongoDB.
    ->Integrating with external APIs to fetch weather data and calculate distances.
    ->Implementing pagination and organizing event data into pages.
    ->Handling errors gracefully and providing informative error messages.
